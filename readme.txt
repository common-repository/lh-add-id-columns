LH Add ID Columns adds user and post ID's to the WordPress user, post, page, and custom post type listings.

== Description ==

LH Add ID Columns adds functionality that should be in core. Namely displaying columns listing the user and post ID's on the appropriate admin screens in wp-admin. All such columns are sortbale.

This is extremely useful when you are needing to work with posts and users both in the backend and in the database. 

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is something does not work?  =

LH Add ID Columns, and all [https://lhero.org/](LocalHero) plugins are made to WordPress standards. Therefore they should work with all well coded plugins and themes. However not all plugins and themes are well coded (and this includes many popular ones). 

If something does not work properly, firstly deactivate ALL other plugins and switch to one of the themes that come with core, e.g. twentyfifteen, twentysixteen etc.

If the problem persists please leave a post in the support forum: [https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-add-id-columns/](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-add-id-columns/). I look there regularly and resolve most queries.
